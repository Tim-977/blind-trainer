# Blindfold Memory Trainer

A simple, no-build trainer for practicing **blindfolded Rubik‚Äôs Cube letter sequences**.  
Made for fun, training, and possibly to live on [jperm.net](https://jperm.net/).

---

## What this is

When solving BLD (blindfolded) you need to **memorize long strings of letters** that correspond to edge and corner pieces. That‚Äôs what this trainer does:

- ‚úÖ Generates real **edge** and **corner** letter sequences  
- ‚úÖ Lets you pick **edges only**, **corners only**, or **both**  
- ‚úÖ Lets you set the **length range** (min/max letters) or use presets (Easy / Normal / Extreme)  
- ‚úÖ Supports different **buffers** 
- ‚úÖ Optional **distraction task** simple math problem before recall (to imitate distractions during a real solve)
- ‚úÖ Records **memorization time only** (from reveal ‚Üí ‚ÄúReady‚Äù)  
- ‚úÖ Tracks accuracy, full solves, and last/median/average/best memorization times  
- ‚úÖ Light/Dark theme toggle


### The best part: you can practice it without even having a Rubik‚Äôs Cube ‚Äî just pure memory training
